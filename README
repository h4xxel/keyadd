Keyadd is a small utility for automatically adding a users login password
for remote servers to the gnome keyring. This is intended to be used in
a business/enterprise environment in conjunction with for example gvfs-mount,
to automatically mount sftp and samba shares on login, without having to ask
for the users' password.

To get started, run "make && sudo make install", copy keyadd.conf to /etc/,
and edit it with the servers you want to be mountable without asking for
password. You will then have to configure PAM; see pam-config.example.
